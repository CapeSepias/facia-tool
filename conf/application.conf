# Database configuration
# ~~~~~ 
# You can declare as many datasources as you want.
# By convention, the default datasource is named `default`

# You can disable evolutions if needed

# Logger
# ~~~~~
# You can also configure logback (http://logback.qos.ch/), by providing a logger.xml file in the conf directory.
#
# Even though we do this, Play still inherits a standard logback configuration which defines 'play' and
# 'application' loggers which create `logs/application.log`. The default configuration also logs ROOT at
# ERROR which is not useful for us.
