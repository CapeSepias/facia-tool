# Editions: deleting an issue

Open the issue you need to delete, then open the javascript console and paste the following:

```
await deleteIssue()
```

You will then have a final opportunity to confirm or cancel.
If you click 'OK', that issue is deleted and gone, kaput, never to be seen again.  Don't come crying to Ed Tools.
